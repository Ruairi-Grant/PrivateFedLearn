Derived from https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded-devices

Client test and server test:
for testing connecction between two devices over a network

Embedded-devices:
Following tutorial from https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded-devices
Instructions:

# TODO: add the above Instructions
# TODO: figure out how to get the final centralized metrics printed on the terminal
# TODO: Figure out what metrics to include for this
# TODO: create new dir of metrics to be included
# TODO: add Differential Privacy
# TODO: add Homomerphic Encryption


Centralized:
Using squezenet defined in https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-squeezenet
note: the above squeezenet may require keras version 2.XX,
use normalization function from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68047460/tensorflow-version-of-pytorch-transforms

# HIGH PRIORITY
# TODO: Include the test data in the test set, this could be either the test set or the val and test set - maybe put the download data script in a seperate script
# TODO: Figure out a way to get a confusion matrix and classification report
# TODO: Get script to create a new dir with all the images and data needed for the report
# TODO: Experiment with bringing the rescaling back, try other scaling and standardization techniques
# TODO: look at ways of loading the data without image_dataset_from_directory

# LOW PRIORITY
# TODO: Look into using a cache for loaded images
# TODO: Investigate message "filling up shuffle buffer"
# TODO: experiment with techniques to make white stand out more in images
# TODO: experiment with other hyperparamaters
# TODO: Experiment with data augmentation



Datasets foldar:
Diabetic reitinopaty data from Dopamine: Differentially Private Federated Learning on Medical Data and https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data
use kaggle competitions download -c aptos2019-blindness-detection to download data
test does not have targets so this cannot be used
