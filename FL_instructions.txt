Client test and server test:
for testing connecction between two devices over a network

Embedded-devices:
Following tutorial from https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded-devices
Instructions:

Centralized:
Using squezenet defined in https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-squeezenet

use normalization function from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68047460/tensorflow-version-of-pytorch-transforms

Datasets foldar:
Diabetic reitinopaty data from Dopamine: Differentially Private Federated Learning on Medical Data and https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data
use kaggle competitions download -c aptos2019-blindness-detection to download data
test does not have targets so this cannot be used
